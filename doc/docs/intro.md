title: Waii CLI
---

Welcome to the documentation for Waii - the worlds most powerful SQL API built on LLM agents. This documentation provides detailed information on how to use the CLI to interact with the system.

The CLI allows enables users to generate, explain, describe, modify, transcode, optimize and run SQL queries from text input, as well as manage the semantic layer, handle database connections, perform semantic search, and access the history of generated queries. You can also generate visualizations from the SQL you are working with.

Whether you are looking to bulk edit queries, or to get familiar with a large SQL code base, or to migrate between SQL dialects, the CLI has something for you.
